      <h3><b>The Case of Agriculture & Technology</b></h3>
      <h5>The awaiting development call, <span class="w3-opacity">April 2, 2019</span></h5>
      <h6>Writer: <u><i>Anway Somani</i></u></h6>
      <p>Agriculture is generally the art of cultivating plants and livestock for a livelihood. Although in the current era, agriculture, as a domain is associated with many different domains like agriculture as political scope, agriculture as religious belief, agriculture as growth of science, agriculture as a cultural profession, agriculture as economical assister, and many more. And these different fields appear to be scaling opportunities of their own.<br>But the only field, that is merely associated with agriculture in India is the technological fields. Unlike the other countries, India has not managed to be as much advanced as the other countries like the United State of America(known for its technical methods for farming on large lands), Japan(known for being the most technically growing country), South Korea(known for being the only country in Asia that can beat China andJapan in terms of technology), and several others. India definitely lies in the top 10 categories for being able to scale technology rapidly, but hasn't been able to scope the agricultural field to that extent.
      	<br>Thus a severe development is waiting at the doorstep of growth of this field, awaiting to be welcomed!</p>

      <h3><b>Solution to the Problem Statement of Agriculture & Technology</b></h3>
      <h5>The Resolve, <span class="w3-opacity">April 5, 2019</span></h5>
      <h6>Writer: <u><i>Anway Somani</i></u></h6>
      <p>Being past the question and the problem statement to resolve for the expansion of technology with agriculture, Upjau brings an initiative to support the agriculture sector to cope up with the current trend of the technology. Upjau(earlier Agrocart) aims to provide simple and scalable assistance to the members of the sector, by providing them technical assistance for daily life problems as well as several risk encounters which occur during regulations of work.<br>
	Upjau aims to clearly mechanise the entire system for farming, product specification to consumers, and goods-to-customer service by working on different technologies to provide simple aid to the common problems of the members of the sector.<br>
	Although it looks quite simple, the agriculture industry is an advanced domain(without the technology), as it requires a lot of data for processing, requires a lot of manpower for handling, and several other purposes. If the domain is well looked for the upcoming growth, it will not be easy at all to implement a technical system to the aids of the members.<br>
	For the sake of holding and managing, a lot of skills and stakeholders are required to handle the processing and management of transactions, as well as monitor the continuous development that take place concurrently to daily transactions. For the same, Upjau presents an initiative to provide physical assistance for such monitoring and issue-handling, and be present for the assistance of the members at local-level, after-all, an acquaintance is more trusted than a far-existing customer care.<br>
	Further implementations of Upjau aims to bring forward the young generation to cope-up and expand their knowledge, as well as share their valuable inputs for the development of the sector.<br>
	At Upjau, we aim to make the world a better place to live, and the Agricultre sector, a better trade to be dealt with!<br>
